    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Alex Egerev. I was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. I have lived in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p> I am taking this bootcamp in order to get new skills needed to get a job as a computer programmer. </p>
    <p> I know a lot of programming languages, including:
      <ul>
        <li> Java </li>
          <li> C++</li>
        <li> PHP</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p> Fun fact about me: I am an EXPERT at all things One Piece. The Straw Hat Crew is the best crew ever.
        And mark my words: Luffy is the man who will be the King Of the Pirates!
    </p>
